				<h4>The Origin</h4>
				<p class="bottom-space">
					This is honestly how I got into Entrepreneurship. I had called over Aakash Adesara and Ishan Sharma (high school friends) to work
					on a Kohl's Case Competition in February of 2017, and we got to talking about the MVP Aakash had built with Dee at HackDavis. An Alexa Assistant for
					Alzheimer's. We figured, "Hey, let's see what we can do!"
					<br><br>
					If you want to talk comedy of errors, that's basically what the first three months was. Our "team" blew up to 27 people. We
					didn't even have a working product, market validation, nothing. We just kept doing medical research, aimlessly building product,
					writing press releases, researching the legal implications, and going entirely off of gut. We had no clue what we were doing.
					<br><br>
					We were in Free Ventures, a part of The House's Founders Program at UC Berkeley. There, we learned to make pitch decks and sell a
					vision to VCs, but we still did absolutely nothing with regard to market research and validation. Halfway through the program, we
					thought: "Hey, why are we making this only for Alzheimer's? Let's just make it a health-based voice system."
					<br><br>
					Genius. What start-up ever reaches success by targeting only one vertical at the beginning
				</p>
				<h4>Whipped Into Shape</h4>
				<p class="bottom-space">
					During the semester, we decided to apply to the Lightspeed Summer Fellowship Program. Much to our surprise, we were selected.
					We honestly hadn't done much for about a month. Our "departments" hadn't met. The team of 27 wasn't getting anything actually
					done. We disbanded the team, and the four of us (Aakash, Dee, Ishan, and I) set out to Lightspeed where hopefully we'd be set
					straight.
					<br><br>
					We were partnered with the head of the program and a main partner of the firm, John Vrionis. It's been a year now and I still
					remember exactly what he said when we came in and told him we pivoted into being a general health-based platform.
					<br><br>
					"Everything you guys are doing is wrong."
					<br><br>
					Talk about a slap to the face. We were eager, excited, but most of all blind. As we passed through the program and met with John,
					we began to learn about the importance of the Lean Start-Up Methodolgy. What did it mean to Build, Measure, and Learn? What is
					hypothesis testing?
					<br><br>
					We started off with a basic assignment: talk to 50 people. We realized, we hadn't really spoken with anyone. We knew nothing about
					our product, our industry, our target customers. As Lightspeed progressed, we learned more about developing a "Desperate Who" profile,
					identifying a market-segment need, asking the write questions, building a product around must-haves rather than feature requests.
					<br><br>
					We hadn't completely flopped. We managed to pull off six successful sales. During our product set-up days, that was when I realized
					that this is what I wanted to do. The joy on senior's faces and their informal caregiver's faces as we showed them our tool would
					provide both empowerment and assurance filled me with warmth. I wanted to continue, I wanted to make an impact. I want to develop
					technologies and businesses that make the world easier for all of us. That's what drives me to this date.
				</p>
				<h4>The End of the Beginning</h4>
				<p class="bottom-space">
					We went back to school in August, planning to work on the business, but over the last year, we had watched the industry develop from
					out of nowhere. We went from being the only ones in the informal caregiving technology space, to the most dated in a matter of months.
					Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, everything just quickly came in and took over the segment. There was no time to fight back.
					<br><br>
					We learned <i> a lot </i> from this first venture. Lessons that we would carry with us throughout life and future ventures.
					<br><br>
					<b>Always understand your problem</b> People don't buy from start-ups unless they're desperate for a solution. It's your responsibility
					to know your market segment better than they know themselves. That's the only way you'll attract the attention and narrow down on a
					vertical that you can inhabit and dominate. Know what that "Desperate Who" looks like.
					<br><br>
					<b>Start Small</b> It's important to fail fast and fail hard. The more time you spend, the larger your team, the more resources you
					invest in attempting to build an unvalidated product, the more time and resources you are going to waste. Don't start with teams of
					27. Don't start with the legal analysis. Don't start with the CSR. Dive into attacking a problem and solve that problem 10x better than
					anything else out there.
					<br><br>
					<b>Be Ruthlessly Resourceful</b> Hunt every lead, have every conversation, talk to as many people as you can. Don't be scared about being
					in a stealh mode because you need to learn as much as possible and you can't do that from a position of fear. Fight that. Talk to who you
					need to in order to understand a concept or existing solution. Then do what you can to make things better. Never be afraid to ask for help.
					People always want to offer their wisdom (especially if you're a student).
