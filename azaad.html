						<p>My painful lesson in leadership from dance.</p>
					</i>

					<hr style="border-color: #bbb">
					Azaad taught me A LOT. If there's any part of my life in dance that defines growth, improvement,
					resillience,
					strength, and learning, it's through Azaad. When I first joined Azaad my freshmen year, I came in
					surrounded
					mostly by other boys who had already been trained for a year. Naturally, I wanted to be on par, so I
					took extra
					care to ensure that I would be a comparable dancer.
					<br><br>
					I put in countless extra hours, even throughout the cuts on
					my toes and the concussions from stunts. By the end of my freshmen year, I had had one crazy year of
					success, but,
					by the end of the year, none of the guys wanted to return. I wanted to come back another year. Not
					necessarily to win,
					but to give back to Azaad and give them models that I had when I joined. End of my freshmen year, I
					was elected captain.
					<br><br>
					We had 5 returners. A team of 26 down to 5. I still gave my all to that year and it taught me so
					much. I wasn't the most
					social person going into the year, but with the requisite of leadership came the development of
					critical social skills.
					I learned to manage a brand new team of 23. I learned to balance the importance of the
					organization's goals with the
					individual
					attention that each member needs and deserves.
					<br><br>
					As a props director, one of the biggest take aways was the importance of prototyping. We took on the
					incredible feat of
					building
					a ginormous 8 foot mirror out of shatter-proof materials. In other words, we built a huge mirror
					using reflective paper
					and wood,
					and then figured out how to collapse it into a couple of duffel bags. I couldn't have been prouder
					of us. We actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnkfd6mtfeE">made it work</a>. It didn't
					come easy though. We had over 8 small scale prototypes and 2 large scale
					prototypes before
					we got to the point where we could assemble 3 of them from scratch in 3 hours.
					<br><br>
					Above all, the biggest lesson I took away was that leadership is not about self-sacrifice. That all
					came crashing down
					at the last
					competition of the year. I had been on about 2-3 hours of sleep for the whole semester. I knew I was
					not performing my
					best, but I
					thought it was okay because at least my teammates would be in solid condition. I was wrong. My body
					gave out on me after
					months of
					exhaustion and injuries. During our last practice of the year, I tore a ligament. I couldn't dance.
					I
					couldn't perform.
					The team I was working so hard to take stress off of had to stay up 4 extra hours because of me. I
					was one of the male
					leads. Storytelling,
					dancing, formations, stunts, much of it revolved around me, now they had to redo all of it. The team
					was exhausted going
					into the competition.
					<br><br>
					Leadership is just not about doing what's best for the team. It's about doing what's best for the
					team <i> and</i> you.
					<br><br>
					Update: When I returned to Azaad in 2020, I was still suffering from residual pain due to the torn ligament while dancing. I paced myself carefully, sitting out of practice when I need to, and putting my health ahead of my heart's love for dance. I'm proud to share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd1z5bTonMM">the resulting performance was a resounding success.</a>
