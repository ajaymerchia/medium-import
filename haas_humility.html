                        Humility (noun): Recognizing and accepting blame for failures and taking action to prevent them in the future.
                        <br><br>
                        Humility has been a struggle for me since I was 2. My parents show me home videos where it is clear that I love
                        being the center of attention. My brother would be singing and I would jump in front of the camera to show off my
                        beautifully nasal voice. I was the first-born; I believed I was the most adorned. With that came confidence – maybe
                        a bit too much.
                        <br><br>
                        I grew up with extreme confidence in the belief that hard work always prevails. I believed I controlled my destiny
                        and my success down to the last variable. But that’s seldom the case.
                        <br><br>
                        I took an interest in real estate in high school and by Summer of 2017, I was working as a realtor for Intero.
                        That’s when I realized: I couldn’t control everything.
                        <br><br>
                        I was working with my first client. The market was hot living next to Apple in Cupertino, and he was in love with a
                        home listed for $1.45M. By the book, it seemed like I did everything right: I researched comparable properties, read
                        inspection reports, gauged the market from the listing agent and open houses. But it all fell apart in the end.
                        <br><br>
                        Even after proving the house would sell over $1.55M, he still felt $1.4M was competitive. I knew how much he wanted
                        this home. His daughter had already picked out her room, they loved the neighborhood, it was the home for them. I
                        didn’t want to make him uncomfortable. I was understanding and empathetic, and we wrote the offer.
                        <br><br>
                        The home sold for $1.58M.
                        <br><br>
                        That was a big loss to me. As tempting as it might be to blame the client for not understanding the market, I had to
                        acknowledge, that was my fault. I didn’t communicate properly. I realized I couldn’t control every variable. I spent
                        days rethinking how I could’ve done things differently. My dog must’ve thought I was crazy with all the speeches he
                        had to listen to. Then it hit me.
                        <br><br>
                        The next time, I didn’t present the sale price based on research. I let them conduct their own guided analysis. I
                        showed them how to use real estate tools. My research manifested as advice and instruction, but the decision was
                        ultimately theirs. It was a fusion of learning and professional advice that made them feel respected and valued.
                        Since the shift in strategy, my clients have not lost a single offer.
                        <br><br>
                        I realized humility requires recognizing your failures and actually working to improve it. Often that involves
                        stepping away from your ego and knowledge and giving ownership of processes to others. There’s no perfect way to
                        share ideas. Everyone thinks differently. But if I orient my advice through humility, I can build a collaborative
                        community where we work together to analyze situations, not a competitive one. I can build nursery for ideas, not a
                        battleground.
