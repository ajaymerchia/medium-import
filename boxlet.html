				<h4>How Long Does it take to Start?</h4>
				<p class="bottom-space">
					The trio is back at it! Me, Aakash Adesara, and Ishan Sharma had the idea to put this together.
					Having learned lots from our first start-up, we knew exactly how to get to work. Start with the
					"Desperate Who" profile, do the market research, validate an MVP, and get selling. What took us
					three months in Lightspeed last year was accomplished in three weeks.
				</p>

				<h4>Week 1: Research, Research, Research</h4>
				<p class="bottom-space">
					We spent a couple hours discussing who the target audience would
					be: International Students with nowhere to store their stuff, or Out-of-State Students in a similar
					situation.
					<br><br>
					The morning of April 22nd, we set out to talk to as many students as possible. It wasn't the hottest beginning.
					I got affirmative responses from four out of thirty people, Aakash got even fewer. Ishan did a little better with
					six affirmative responses. We asked the right questions to get a good signal of the market. At the end of the day,
					we agreed there was a lukewarm signal worth pursuing.
					<br><br>
					We decided to reach out to Dre, who worked at BoxCamp, providing a centralized storage solution. We found out the
					right marketing strategies and discussed different ways to attract student attention in the final two weeks of school.
					We did a little more interviewing around and started mapping out our marketing efforts for the coming week. We applied
					to the Haas Fund and received a grant of $5K to build Boxlet for students.
					<br><br>
					That was when the fun began.
				</p>

				<h4>Week 2: Build, Market, Build</h4>
				<p class="bottom-space">
					So it's the week before finals and that means it's time to grab my books . . . and put
					them under my bed. Most of the sales for BoxCamp were within 1 week of move out day.
					With retreats and student org banquets attacking the three of us in what little time we
					had, I knew we had to work fast to be ready.
					<br><br>
					One of the biggest things I learned from my customer interviews was a concern regarding
					safety. We had already discussed that part of the $5K would serve as insurance in case
					someone's belongings were damaged, but there needed to be something more to assure users
					their belongings will be safe. We needed a professional platform to inspire confidence.
					<br><br>
					Honestly, my Web Dev skills were shaky. I mean, I learned some preliminary HTML, CSS, JS,
					and Node.Js for Memory Labs, and a little bit of responsive design for an ASUC Senator campaign,
					but building an entire application with a professional vibe integrating multiple APIs in a
					week was daunting to say the least.
					<br><br>
					Had to start somewhere. I started with a clone of our Memory Labs landing page (if it ain't
					broke, right?). The requirements for the app were entirely different though. Still, if there
					is any thing I learned from Memory Labs, and any theme that revolves around Boxlet, it's that
					you have to "hack it, and hack it fast." I pulled two back-to-back all-nighters building the
					frame of the app. I learned Heroku App Deployment, Facebook and Firebase Authentication, Google
					Maps API, Stripe Integration, Distance Matrices. In other words, I learned enough stuff for 3
					hackathons.
					<br><br>
					Too many Red Bulls later, we had it. Now came the marketing.
					<br><br>
					In the meantime, Ishan had put together a list of people willing to host, but didn't want to
					confirm until after finals because they needed to sort things out with the roommates. Well. . .
					What do we put on our sites? What do people sign-up for? We listed our own places and made a couple
					of fake listings and called it a day. We had letters of intent to ensure that we wouldn't get
					railed with a bunch of storage and confidently moved onto marketing.
					<br><br>
					So we printed out 1500 flyers with promo codes, hired 3 people for $18/hr to come with us, and we
					snuck into the dorms to drop off the flyers. I eventually got a call from ResHall Staff to stop it,
					and we did, but we had already gotten word out. I checked our database: 3 bookings already.
					<br><br>
					As the week continued, a few more bookings came our way. We slightly hiked rates. With finals on the way,
					I figured out how to automatically send beautiful HTML emails upon confirmation. Our app was officially
					100% autonomous. Felt good.
				</p>

				<h4>Week 3: Oh $#*!</h4>
				<p class="bottom-space">
					Went into finals week thinking about my classes. Not the move. Halfway through the week, I checked our database and froze.
					<br><br>
					We hit 40 bookings.
					<br><br>
					"GUYS WE'RE SCREWED" I tapped out to our group chat. We immediately got to thinking of a solution.
					We tripled the rest and decreased availability to deter more bookings. No luck. A few more still
					trickled in.
					<br><br>
					We desperately messaged friends, asking if they'd be willing to host some storage space. Many of them said yes, but they
					had already finished finals and wouldn't be back until June. We got a couple of randoms to sign-up, but the process was
					slow in the middle of finals week.
					<br><br>
					Finals weeks came to a close. We had 40 bookings, capacity for maybe half. In a month or two, we would have enough as people
					came back to Berkeley for their internships, but for now, we were at a loss for words. A big takeaway is honestly that with
					start-ups, whatever goes, goes. If that means cramming 20 people's stuff into our apartments, so. be. it.
					<br><br>
					It was move-out day. I woke up at 6AM, rented a pick-up truck for $40, and went to Home Depot. I then proceeded to buy 150
					boxes from Home Depot. We bought them for $1.67 and sold them for $5. Pretty solid margins. We then proceeded to store everyone's
					stuff inside Ishan and Aakash's apartment. By the end of the day, it looked like computer science office hours before the midterm.
					Cramped was an understatement, but hey, it worked.
					<br><br>
					We packed it up and called it a day. There was no more living space in their apartment so they crashed at mine for the night as we
					made plans for the future, and knocked the hell out after three weeks of madness.

				<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
				<p class="bottom-space">
					<b>Just Start.</b> Thinking about what to do for half a day is a <i>WASTE</i> You're not going to learn what you need unless
					you get out there boots on the ground and start doing it. The biggest impediment to your progress is doubt. Whether it's a
					signal that's only lukewarm, or that extra practice midterm you could be doing, there's always another way to spend your time.
					The problem is you don't know what you're missing out on until you do it, so just start!
					<br><br>
					<b>Hack it and Hack it Fast.</b> Find a hack, find a solution, find a workaround for every step of the way. Spending your time
					planning every detail is pointless. It's not like things are going to go according to plan anyway. Your site will break,
					your business model will be laughed at. You will overstock, understock, and sometimes just stock. With a start-up things are
					too random to reliably predict so just own what you have and hack your way through the rest of it.
					<br><br>
					<b>Resillience is Key.</b> If there's one thing you can count on, it's that <i>NOTHING</i> is going to go according to plan.
					When you're working a start-up you need to understand that things are going to be inconvenient, tough, and insane.
					The only way you get through this is by being agile enough in responding to the "Oh $#*!" moments such that they never
					throw you off balance.
					<br><br>
					<b>Believe. </b>You're 10 times more capable than you think. Never built a full app before? Seldom driven a pick-up truck? First start-up?
					It doesn't really matter. At the end of the day, no one <i>really</i> knows what they're doing in life. We're all just stumbling
					through trying to make sense of a crazy set of situations. So don't be afraid to take an extra jump and do a little tumble. You'll
					find yourself on your own feet much more often than you expect.
