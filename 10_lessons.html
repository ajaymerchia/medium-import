                    I. Don't act like you know what you're doing. You don't. Take the time to explore and find what you love before you
                    settle in.
                    <br><br>
                    II. Don't let anyone dictate what the 'right' path is. It is whatever you <i>feel</i> is right.
                    <br><br>
                    III. Be direct, but kind. Especially with housemates and roommates, letting things seethe is never the answer.
                    <br><br>
                    IV. Just go with the flow. Things are going to go wrong, but as long as you stay happy through the process, it will
                    be fine.
                    <br><br>
                    V. Make the most of every second. Your wasting no one's time but your own by flipping through Buzzfeed in those 10
                    minutes before class starts.
                    <br><br>
                    VI. Go to lecture. It's easy to shirk responsibility in college, but as soon as you tell yourself its okay, it's a
                    slippery slope to failure.
                    <br><br>
                    VII. Peer pressure is easy to give into. It can be hard to stay in and work when your friends are going out or up to
                    other activities. Know what's important to you and stick to it.
                    <br><br>
                    VIII. Finding a balance is hard. Work, Life, School, Social, all these worlds will compete for your time. Segmenting
                    by the minute/hour is much worse than the day/week.
                    <br><br>
                    IX. Take care of yourself first. You can't do anything without your health. Sleep off sickness, go to the doctor, do
                    what you need to do to feel better because when you get back to it you'll be 10x efficient.
                    <br><br>
                    X. It's fast. Don't let yourself waste a moment of it. Being a student is a prilivelge. There's so much you have
                    access to as a student. Cherish it before its gone.
